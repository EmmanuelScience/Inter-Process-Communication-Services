make sure to free task nodes after they are used

to avoid deadlocks be sure to only hold 1 lock at a time
dont lock multiple lists or objects
dont hold mem_info while locking a list

after compiling, look at all the warnings and address them. they probably point to bugs

to implement the client, basically just need to parse the server messages and then keep pulling/pushing data from the segments that were given by the server
do it in a loop until the full file is read, or the full compressed len is read
can probably steal most of the server code for this

how to implement QoS:

assume use some sort of random serial number maker to give each client an id

then change the check client q thread to do a QoS search on the client q rather than just popping the head

actually due to the way the threads run, we probably need a datastructure that maps client id to a linked list of client task objects


clientA -> request 1, request 2

clientB -> request 1, request 2, request 3, request 4

then keep track of the most recent client serial number that was hit (store the serial numbers in an arrayqueue or another easily modifieable circular loopable structure) and then round robin jump to the next client in the list and pop its task queue

just hardcode the client serial numbers in the client, or generate them once in a client process, and pass the same value into sync_compress each time it is called
